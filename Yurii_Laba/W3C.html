    <h2>W3C Candidate Recommendation, <time>8 August 2017</time></h2>

            <img src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/WWW/w3c_home_nb-v.svg" style="width:104px;height:100px;">

        <ol>
            <li><a name="Background">Background</a>
                <p>HTML is the World Wide Webâ€™s core markup language. Originally,
                    HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing
                    scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted,
                    over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even
                    applications.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a name="Audience">Audience</a>
                <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in
                    this
                    specification, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in this
                    specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or implementations
                    with respect to the requirements of this specification.
                    This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
                    familiarity
                    with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for
                    completeness.
                    More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler introduction to the topic.
                    In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of some
                    of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode,
                    character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not essential.</p>

            </li>
            <li><a name="Scope">Scope</a>
                <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
                    semantic-level
                    scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents to dynamic
                    applications. The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for
                    media-specific
                    customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at the
                    end
                    of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part of the
                    language).
                    The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
                    hardware
                    configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be expected to
                    use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of applications, this
                    specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by users on
                    an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low CPU requirements.
                    Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching systems, games
                    (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books, communications
                    software
                    (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document editing software,
                    etc.</p>
